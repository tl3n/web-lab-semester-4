              Came for Jeremy Allen White and the rest were also at his level
            </h3>
            <p>
              To say this is an intense series is an understatement. Comedy -
              not so much, but just enough. I am glad the episodes were short
              because of how incredibly intense all the episodes were. But so
              was the growth of his crew and the arc of the story. To make them
              longer for lengths sake would have ruined the rhythm and let us
              off the hook - which is where we wanted to be. Yep - came for
              Jeremy AW, but fell in love with the rest of them along the way.
              SEASON TWO, as many have said, IS A MUST!!!

            <p>
              Get out of the kitchen. This show is so spot on about how real
              kitchens function. Having worked in several high end and lower end
              restaurants. I can tell you this is the real deal. For all those
              low star reviewers, you just don't get it. This is not a glitzy
              Hollywood romanticized fantasy. Great acting, accurate terminology
              and technique. Absolutely love it! Hope there will be more.

            <h3>Dramedy not comedy</h3>
            <p>
              I am really enjoying this show. I've made it through six episodes
              and the character development is great. I am already rooting for
              so many of the characters. It's turning into a real feel-good
              show. The casting and acting are great. I love the writing and the
              setting/cinematography are as realistic as it can get. With so
              many choices out there I find it oddly difficult to find shows
              that I truly enjoy. But this is one of them.

            <h3>Beautiful television</h3>
            <p>
              Great acting, writing, direction. Shots and scenes are artful and
              not pretentious, soundtrack choice is excellent. Having worked in
              a kitchen and a fan of cooking/food shows, Bourdain, this is well
              conceived masterpiece. Sure the episodes are short and only 8
              episodes, but if that was its first and only season, it was short
              and sweet, and even the little bit of filler made sense. A nice
              tight package, a must watch!
